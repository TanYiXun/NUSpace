## 2026-09-17 - Phase 0 Prototype A Basemap

- Task: choose a non-Google basemap for the first MapLibre prototype.
- Source checked: OpenFreeMap homepage and quick start documentation.
- Finding: OpenFreeMap provides MapLibre-compatible styles at `https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/liberty`, currently with no API key required.
- Attribution requirement: `OpenFreeMap © OpenMapTiles Data from OpenStreetMap`.
- Decision: use OpenFreeMap for Phase 0 Prototype A only, document the source in `data/sources.yml`, and revisit production basemap strategy before MVP deployment.
- Confidence: high for prototype use; production dependency requires later ADR.
